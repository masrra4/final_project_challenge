Explanation:
#Cleaning Part
At the bigining I opened the file and read the table,
then I removed the unnecessery columns like (unnammed0,Ranking,URL,ID_TA),
After that I removed NAN values from tables.
then check the rows If there are some NaN values or na by using df.isnull()
Other way to check by calculating the percentage of missingness.
show the missingness values by importing missingno library,then we discovered there are no missing values .
show it as a matrix ,it is another way to check the missing values.
useing df.info and using df.nunique to see the information of the dataframe.
remove the [] from the review column by adding na_values='[[], []]'to the read instructuure
#Visualisation part
At the bigining I opened PowerPi then I explored all columns togethers by using the probabilities so I had 110 figures.
then I tried to make a relation between the columns and I picked just 10 figures ,then I did the dashboard .
this dashboard would help travel agents make recommendation to travellers on the best food destination for their trips across Europe
The agent or clint can find the useful information that he wants by using this dashboard,for example he could choose the specific city then see all kinds of
restaurants there with the range of price and rating and cusine style and review and the number of reviews.
He can also search by the rating to find suitable restaurants for him  or search by price  then  he could find his requirements .
also he could search by the cusine style to see What he wants,or by the name of the restaurants to find suitable result.
#upload the dashboard online.
well,by using these steps I could upload it online but I should pay for it ,so I couldn't do it .
